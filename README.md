My Hotel Booking Website Project Exam 2 for my 2.year at Noroff.

## Description

A Hotel booking website for a local agency called Northern Light Hotels, where visitors can find accommodations, book hotels and contact the owners.
The admin can also add hotels, and view and manage both enquiries and messages from customers. The hotels and enquiries are stored on a Strapi API hosted 
on Heroku.
It includes:
- Homepage with search bar (auto dropdown with hotel names that matches what has been written).
- A results page with all hotels.
- A hotel specific page with hotel details.
- An enquiry paage (this is built into the hotel detail page)
- A contact page.
- A login page that makes use of JWT tokens.
- An Admin section that displays bookings, messages and the option to create new establishments.
